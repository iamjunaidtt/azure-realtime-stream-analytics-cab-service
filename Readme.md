## Azure Stream Analytics for Real-Time Cabe Service Monitoring

### Real time analysis of cab booking service

This project is about keeping track of cab services in real-time. People use services like Uber and Ola a lot for their daily travel. The diagram in the project shows how companies monitor bookings in real-time using a Power BI dashboard.

Real-time analytics is when you analyze and measure data right when it goes into a system. This lets users quickly understand and make conclusions as soon as the data arrives into their system. Businesses can respond fast with real-time analytics, spotting opportunities and avoiding problems before they happen.

Real-time analytics insights may help organizations stay ahead of the competition. These pipelines for streaming data generally follow a 3 step process, i.e., Ingest, Analyze and Deliver.
